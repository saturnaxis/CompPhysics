                "Numerical integration is a fundamental skill in computational physics because it allows one to evaluate increasingly complex integrals with a high accuracy *in seconds to minutes*.  If you've ever tried to evaluate particularly nasty integrals, you notice that those can take pages of algebra, transformations, and still only get to an approximate form.  It is especially frustrating when one makes algebraic mistakes and you have to do it over.  In this chapter, we will review basic integration methods that you've learned in Calculus and develop those methods in **python**.  After reading this chapter, check out some python packages that others have developed to make the process of numerical integration easier to access using [quadpy](https://github.com/nschloe/quadpy).\n",

Due to the precise repetitiveness of a computer, an integral can be evaluated in a straightforward manner.  You may recall that you first performed integration by counting the number of boxes (or quadrilaterals) that you could place beneath a curve.  As a result, numerical integration is also called *quadrature* even when it comes to more complex methods.\n",
