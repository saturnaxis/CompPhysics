    "# Integration\n",
    "Numerical integration is a fundamental skill in computational physics because it allows one to evaluate increasingly complex integrals with a high accuracy in seconds to minutes.  If you've ever tried to evaluate particularly nasty integrals, you notice that those can take pages of algebra, transformations, and still only get to an approximate form.  It is especially frustrating when one makes algebra mistakes and you have to do it over.  In this chapter, we will review basic integration methods that you've learned in Calculus and develop those methods in *python*.  After reading this chapter, check out some python packages that others have developed to make the process of numerical integration easier to access using [quadpy](https://github.com/nschloe/quadpy).\n",

    "## Quadrature as box counting\n",
    "The integration of a function usually requires some trickery, where you have to know which variable transformation to apply and when to apply it.  Due to the precise repetativeness of a computer, an integral can be evaluated in a straightforward manner.  You may recall that you first performed integrationby counting the number of boxes, or quadrilaterals, that you could place underneath a curve.  As a result, numerical integration is also called *quadrature* even when it comes to more complex methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start our review with the Riemann definition of an integral, which is given as the limit of the sum over boxes of width *h*:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\displaystyle \\int_a^b f(x)dx = \\lim_{h\\rightarrow 0} \\left[h \\sum_{i=1}^{(b-a)/h} f(x_i) \\right]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Integration_Example](integral_example.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The numercial integral of a fuction *f(x)* is approximated as the equivalent of a finite sum of quadrilaterals with a height defined as *f(x)* and width $w_i$ to get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\displaystyle \\int_a^b f(x)dx \\simeq \\sum_{i=1}^{N} f(x_i)w_i$. (1)\n",
    "\n",
    "You will notice that this is similar to the Riemann definition, but the limit for an infintetesimial box size is removed and the upper limit for the summantion is redined as the number $N$ of quadrilaterals.  Finally, each of the function values $f(x_i)$ are weighted by $w_i$.  As we make $N$ larger, the approximation will become more exact but this comes at a cost.  First, a computer holds numbers to a finite precision and some values in $N$ won't increase the accuracy of the integration.  Second, we'll find that more calculations take more wall time and we may have to wait an extremely long time for the integration to finish.  Eventually we have to truncate the sum to get the \"best\" approximation and we have to remember that we are making a tradeoff.\n",
    "\n",
    "Something that you should **never** do is to attempt a numerical integration when the integrand contains a singularity **without** first removing the singularity by hand.  Some ways to remove the singularity is to assign intervals so that the singularity lies at an endpoints or by a change of variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\displaystyle \\int_{-1}^1 |x|f(x)dx = \\int_{-1}^0 f(-x)dx + \\int_0^1 f(x)dx$,\n",
    "\n",
    "or\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\displaystyle \\int_0^1 x^{1/3}dx = \\int_0^1 3y^3,\\;\\; (y=x^{1/3})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, you might have an integrand that changes very quickly/slowly and scaling the boxes according to the variation may be necessary.  There are several approches to scale the boxes for your integration and we'll explore two of them in the following sections: Trapezoidal Rule and Simpson's Rule that you may recall from Calculus."

    "## Trapezoidal Rule\n",
    "\n",
    "The trapezoid integration rule uses $f(x)$ at *evenly* spaced values of $x$, with $N$ points.  The first point $x_1$ locates the left-side boundary and $x_N$ locates the right-side boundary to form the integration region [$x_1$, $x_N$] or [a,b].  The brackets indicate that the endpoints are included and then we can divide up the intergtation region into $N-1$ intervals or chunks.  The interval width is defined as $h$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$h = \\frac{b-a}{N-1}$\n",
    "\n",
    "and the location of each point along the interval is defined linearly because each interval has a fixed width.  Thus, we write the iterative formula for $x_i$ as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$x_i = a + (i-1)h,$\n",

    "![Trapezoid_Rule](Trap_rule.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The trapezoid rule takes each integration interval and constructs a trapezoid of width $h$.  Recall the area of a trapezoid is the average height of the two (long) parallel sides multiplied by the width.  To define the height for each side, we evaluate the function $f(x)$ at boundary points for the given interval, $f(x_i)$ and $f(x_{i+1})$.  The area of each such trapezoid is:\n",

    "$\\displaystyle \\int_{x_i}^{x_{i+1}} f(x)dx \\simeq \\frac{f(x_i)+f(x_{i+1})}{2}h$.\n",

    "In terms of our standard integration formula (Eq. 1 in Section 3.1), the weights $w_i = 1/2$.  To apply the trapezoidal rule to the entire integration region [a,b], we simply add the contributions from each interval:\n",

We obtain a crude estimate of the *approximation* or *algorithmic error $\\varepsilon$* and the *relative error $\\epsilon$* by expanding $f(x)$ in a Taylor series around the midpoint of the integration interval.

    "Another source of error is the *round-off* error, which we assume is random and can thus take the form $\\epsilon_{\\rm ro} \\simeq \\sqrt{N}\\epsilon_m$.  The $\\epsilon_m$ represents machine precision, which is $\\epsilon \\sim 10^{-15}$ for double precision (the standard for science).  You can find more on data types [here](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/02.01-understanding-data-types.html).  Assuming double precision, we want to determin an $N$ that minimizes the total error (round-off + approximation), $\\epsilon_{\\rm tot} \\simeq \\epsilon_{ro} + \\varepsilon$.  This occurs when the approximation error (which depends on $N$) approaches the round-off error.  Through some clever scaling, we find that\n",

    "## Integration by Stone Throwing\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you need to find the area of a shape with an irregular boundary.  The standard methods can be quite complex and there are simpler means of obtaining an approximate value.  Another context is when you want to perform multidimensional integrals.  These types of integrals are easily solved through a *sampling* technique with random numbers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "![Stone_throwing](stone_throwing.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you need to find the area of a pond, where most ponds are not regularly shaped due to weathering and erosion.  You can use the following algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Walk off a box that completely encloses the pond and remove an pebbles lying on the ground within the box.\n",
    "2. Measure the lengths of the sides in natural units (feet or meters).  This tells you the area of the enclosing box $A_{\\rm box}$.\n",
    "3. Grab a bunch of pebbles, count their number, and throw them up in the air in random directions. (Wear a hat!)\n",
    "4. Count the number of splashes in the pond $N_{\\rm pond}$ and the number of pebbles lying on the ground within your box $N_{\\rm box}$.\n",
    "5. Assuming that you threw the pebbles randomly enough, the number of pebbles falling into the pond should be proportional to the area of the pond $A_{\\rm pond}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fraction of pebbles that splash in the pond relative to the total number of pebbles tells you the area within a unit box.  Multiplying by the area of the box $A_{\\rm box}$ in the natural units, then allows you to find the area of the pond:\n",
    "\n",
    "$A_{\\rm pond} = \\frac{N_{\\rm pond}}{N_{\\rm pond}+N_{\\rm box}}A_{\\rm box}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use the sampling technique to perform a 2D integration to determine $\\pi$ (in code!) assuming a circular pond"

More simply, it states that the same area can exist under a complicated curve and within the simplest curve (a horizontal line).\n",

The cannon has a muzzle speed of about 200 m/s and the firing deck is 50 m above sea level.  The Captain has anchored 2000 m off shore relative to the fort walls for the initial battle.
